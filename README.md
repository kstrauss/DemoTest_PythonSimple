# DemoTest_A
A test repo to demonstrate git, developing python for actuaries with the code that should enable an automatic docker build. Key points include:
- branches and use of master
- a requirements.txt file for including dependent libraries
- a pytest file (test_*.py or *_test.py) with the required format for test names
- a dockerfile which could serve as a template for all python docker images in this model

We will use this as a starting point for doing changes.

The example is trivial, but it is such to just demonstrate.
